For facial recognition part, I will collect picture of peopleâ€™s faces and then use facial feathers to identify different people. 
For example, I would choose a sample of 10 people. I take 20 pictures of each person from different angles,
and then analyze the facial feathers of each person by a certain algorithm.
And then, I will test with another set of pictures to check the accuracy. Further implementation of the algorithm will be learned later
